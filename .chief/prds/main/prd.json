  "project": "Responsive mobile UI \u0026 PWA",
  "description": "GiveTwice is a wishlist/gift list app built with Laravel 12, Blade, Tailwind CSS v4, and Alpine.js. While the codebase already uses responsive Tailwind classes across 45 files (~203 occurrences), the mobile experience has gaps: button rows overflow on narrow screens, the guest layout has no hamburger menu, the mobile nav lacks animation and accessibility, and there's no sticky header. On the PWA side, a partial manifest and icons exist, but there is no service worker — meaning the app isn't installable on Android and has no offline capability. This feature makes GiveTwice a polished mobile-first experience that users can install on their home screen (iOS and Android), browse recently viewed lists offline, and — in the future — receive push notifications.",
